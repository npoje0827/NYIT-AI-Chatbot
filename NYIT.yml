- - Student Support Services
  - The role of the dean of students is to represent New York campus students needs to the administration, faculty, and academic departments. The dean of students provides administrative leadership, supervision, and coordination for a number of services and programs, including student engagement, first-year programs, research and assessment, judicial and mediation services, and residence life. In addition, the dean of students is involved in the overall management of disciplinary matters, academic dishonesty issues, new student orientation programs, community service programs, the student handbook, student publications, and commuter programs. Students should contact the dean of students as a primary resource for assistance in navigating campus resources.
- - First-Year Programs
  - The first year of college life is crucial to a successful transition and strengthening a students ability to connect with the New York Tech community. The first-year programs in Long Island and New York City are designed to make the transition easier and focus on teaching students strategies to enhance academic skills, while addressing the need for early social and intellectual bonding with faculty, staff, and peers.
- - Fraternities and Sororities
  - Greek-letter organizations have maintained a proud tradition on college campuses for well over 100.years. Founded upon principles of brotherhood/sisterhood, high academic achievement, and service to the community, these organizations add to the overall quality of life on campus. In Long Island and New York City, New York Tech has long recognized these attributes and has welcomed the formation of these organizations throughout the universitys history. Students interested in joining a Greek-letter organization should discuss the possibility with the current members of several different organizations to find the one that best fits their needs. First-semester freshmen may join a Greek-letter organization if their cumulative high school GPA is 3.0 or better.

- - Can you tell me about the Long Island campus
  - The Long Island (Old Westbury N.Y.) campus was developed around the nucleus of the former C.V. Whitney estate and includes several former North Shore estates. Original buildings have been reconstructed for educational use while retaining the charm of traditional exteriors. To preserve the natural beauty of the landscape, other buildings are clustered in low, modern structures surrounded by trees and open vistas. Classroom buildings and parking areas are connected by walkways through woods and meadows untouched by construction. Plazas connect classroom buildings and act as outdoor rooms for students and faculty. Lectures and informal recreational events are frequently scheduled on campus.
- - Can you tell me about the NYC Manhattan city campus
  - The New York City campus is housed in buildings on Broadway and West 61st Street, just north of Columbus Circle. Its central location, within walking distance of Lincoln Center and Central Park, is easily accessible via subway and bus routes and is close to concert halls, theaters, museums, and libraries. Like the Long Island campus, the New York City campus includes the Offices of Student Life, Counseling and Wellness, Accessibility Services, Career Services, Residence Life, Enrollment Services Center (Enrollment Services, Bursar, Financial Aid, and Registrar), and Experiential Education.
